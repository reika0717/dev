        <h1 id="rdf-summit-for-genome-variations">RDF summit for genome variations</h1>
<p>RDF summit is organized by the Database Center for Life Science (<a href="http://dbcls.rois.ac.jp/">DBCLS</a>).</p>
<h2 id="the-3rd-rdf-summit-in-2018">The 3rd RDF summit in 2018</h2>
<p>Main theme of the 3rd RDF summit is to standardize the RDF representation of genomic variations. As we have succeeded to standardize the annotation of sequence locations with the <a href="http://biohackathon.org/resource/faldo">FALDO</a> ontology during the 1st RDF summit, we would like to use this opportunity to synchronize how to make semantic annotations on genome variations by the international collaboration -- hopefully aligned with the Ensembl/Broad/UCSC/GA4GH etc. projects.</p>
<p>In Japan, the <a href="http://med2rdf.org/">MED2RDF</a> project is working on RDFization of biomedical databases, <a href="http://dbcls.rois.ac.jp/">DBCLS</a>/<a href="https://biosciencedbc.jp/en/">NBDC</a> is developing a new TogoVar database which accumulates Japanese genome variations, and <a href="https://www.amed.go.jp/en/">AMED</a> project is going to provide annotated disease related variants found by the Japanese medical community in the new MGeND database. All those projects have a need to develop a standard representation of variations in RDF.</p>
